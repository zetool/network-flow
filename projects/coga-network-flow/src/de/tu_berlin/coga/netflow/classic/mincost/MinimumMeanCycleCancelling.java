 * This class provides an implementation of the cycle cancelling method to solve

 * cycle cancelling algorithm. In every cycle cancelling step, a cycle of 
 * minimum mean total cost is calculated and augmengted. In comparison to other
 * cycle cancelling strategies, the selection of cycles with minimum mean total 
 * cost leads to a polynomial running time.
